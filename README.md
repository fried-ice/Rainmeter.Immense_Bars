Highly configurable Rainmeter Suite - http://ibloodghosti.deviantart.com/art/Immense-Bars-1-0-498908795


Hi!
I proudly present my second skin suite I made for Rainmeter.

The Immense Bars Suite features the following:

--> it includes skins for clock, CPU, RAM, Network, GPU, different music players, up to 8 HDDs and 5 notes
--> it is highly customizable due to it´s main config file and a seperate style file, where you can easily change any settings
--> it includes 32 and 64bit plugins for HWiNFO to optionally access information about the GPU and different component temperatures

This skin contains icons made by dAKirby309 and the HWiNFO Plugin made by stangowner , thank you guys!
